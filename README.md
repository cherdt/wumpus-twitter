# Hunt the Wumpus, Python version

The goal is to have @wumpus_bot GM for you via twitter.

But it isn't quite done yet.

## How to play

1. Follow @wumpus_bot on twitter.
2. (TODO @wumpus_bot needs to follow you back)
3. Send a DM to @wumpus_bot, e.g. "let's play"
4. @wumpus_bot should reply with an intro and options
5. Moves include "move N" (or just "N") to move to an adjacent cavern, "shoot N" to fire an arrow, "help" for a list of commands, and "quit" to take the coward's way out.

### The Dangers of Wumpus-Hunting

It's completely dark in the caverns where the wumpus lives, but you have other senses:

* You can smell the wumpus. The wumpus is really stinky.
* There's a bit of a breeze near the bottomless pit.
* If you hear something, it's probably the bats.
